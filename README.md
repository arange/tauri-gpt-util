This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Have your openai API key ready

- Rename **.env.example** to **.env**
- Set your own API key

### Run in the browser
To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Run as an app

```bash
npm run tauri dev
# or
yarn tauri dev
# or
pnpm tauri dev
```

This will also start the local server so you can still access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to debug

## Build the desktop app

```bash
npm run tauri build
# or
yarn tauri build
# or
pnpm tauri build
```
